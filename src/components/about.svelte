<div id="about">
	<p>My name is Frankie. I am {age} and I was born in Rome, Italy. I lived there for 5 years. Then I moved to East USA, I was introduced to programming was around 6 or 7. I sticked with python for a while but then tried out some new languages. That was when I started actually getting decent at programming. Soon enough I was using C, which is what I am currently using. I now dabble in some programming language development, but what I am focusing mostly on is Game Development Tool Development. I am working on a Game Framework called Muzzle.</p>
